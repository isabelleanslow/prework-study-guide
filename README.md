# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to learn to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce a webpage. It allows the user to interact with the webpage, and demonstrates a basic outline of how to create one. I have learned to build a webpage, change the colors and outlines, and add JavaScript to produce results in the console.
